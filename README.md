TikTok favorites shuffler

I've always heard people wishing they can shuffle their favorites, so they can watch the videos they added years ago, because we all have thousands of videos in this tab. This very simple Python script allows you to do just that. It reads from a text file you get from downloading your data from tiktok(profile->settings->account->download your data->select data->custom->Activity)(use Favorite Videos.txt) and opens one at random when you provide input.

Features

Randomly selects from your favorites text file and opens a video link in your default web browser.

Simple and interactive command-line interface.

How It Works
Input File: The script asks you to provide the path to the text file containing your favorite video links. 

User Interaction: After providing the file path, type C to shuffle the links and open one randomly in your browser.
